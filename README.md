# Bachelor-Thesis: Explainable Machine Learning in the Context of Illness Detection

## Introduction
This project contains two ".ipynb" Jupiter notebook files and their dataset utilized. The "Parkinson Dataset Notebook.ipynb" utilizes the dataset "parkinson.data". The "Diabetes Dataset Notebook" utlizes the dataset "diabetes.csv".

## Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter Notebook and work with the dataset, you need to have the following software installed:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: python.org.


Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook 

## Get Started
Load the ".ipynb" file with its corresponding dataset into the same Jupiter notebook folder and open the ".ipynb" file, run the cell you want.
